    "1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/2021_WT1/data530/labs/intro.html) ; you will need to accept each lab (for each course) separately.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or GitBash (Windows), and navigate to where you want to create your local copy of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Run ```git clone <Your https repo link>```. For example, I enter ```git clone https://github.com/ubco-mds-2021/<REPO_NAME>-firasm.git```. You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password (use the Personal Access Token or the PAT).\n",

    "\n",

    "8. Run ```git add -A``` to stage all new edits and files in the repository for committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Run ```git commit -m \"<Your commit message>\"``` to make a local commit of your changes. Your commit message should be a short description of what changes were made. You just made your first commit!\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Run ```git push``` to push your local commit to the GitHub server. You may be asked for your GitHub username and password (remember, use your PAT if it's not stored) again. You should now see the changes you made reflected in GitHub's web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. You should repeat steps 7, 8, and 9 everytime you want to commit your changes up to GitHub.com. Otherwise they will only exist locally. I suggest having a minimum of 4 commits in this lab to get some practice on how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you have to enter your PAT every time, something isn't quite right; the PAT should be saved and you shouldn't be prompted for it each time."
