## R, XQuartz, IRkernel, and RStudio

R is another programming language that we will be using a lot in the MDS program. We will use R both in Jupyter notebooks and in RStudio.

### R

Go to [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and download the latest version of R for Mac (Should look something like this: R-3.6.1.pkg). Open the file and follow the installer instructions.

After installation, in Terminal type the following to ask for the version:
```
R --version
```

You should see something like this if you were successful:

```
R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10) -- "Kick Things"
Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin20.4.0 (64-bit)

You are welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License versions 2 or 3.

```

> Note: Although it is possible to install R through conda, we highly recommend not doing so. In case you have already installed R using conda you can remove it by executing `conda uninstall r-base`.

### XQuartz

Some R packages rely on the dependency XQuartz which no longer ships with macOS, thus we need to install it separately. Download it from here: [https://www.xquartz.org/](https://www.xquartz.org/) and follow the installation instructions.

### RStudio

Download the macOS Desktop version of RStudio Desktop from [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Open the file and follow the installer instructions.

To see if you were successful, try opening RStudio by clicking on its icon (from Finder, Applications or Launchpad). It should open and look something like this picture below:

<img src="../images/RStudio.png" alt = ""/>

### Essential R packages

Next, install the key R packages needed for the start of MDS program,
by opening up RStudio and
typing the following into the R console inside RStudio:

```
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'blogdown', 'xaringan', 'renv', 'usethis', 'devtools'))
```

> Note: we will use many more packages than those listed above across the MDS program, however we will manage these using the `renv` package manager (which you will learn about in DSCI 521: Platforms for Data Science).

### IRkernel

The `IRkernel` package is needed to make R work in Jupyter notebooks. To enable this kernel in the notebooks, install by pasting the following command into the RStudio Console:

```
install.packages('IRkernel')
```

Next, open a terminal and type the following
(you can't use RStudio for this step
since it doesn't honor `$PATH` changes in `~/.z_profile`)

```
R -e "IRkernel::installspec()"
```

To see if you were successful, try running JupyterLab and check if you have a working R kernel. To launch the JupyterLab type the following in Terminal:

```
jupyter lab
```

A browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below. Now click on "R" notebook (circled in red on the screenshot below) to launch an JupyterLab with an R kernel.

<img src="../images/jupyter_lab_r_kernel.png" alt = ""/>

Sometimes a kernel loads, but doesn't work as expected. To test whether your installation was done correctly now type `library(tidyverse)` in the code cell and click on the run button to run the cell. If your R kernel works you should see something like the image below:

<img src="../images/jupyter_lab_r_kernel2.png" alt = ""/>

To improve the experience of using R in JupyterLab,
we will add an extension that allows us to setup keyboard shortcuts for inserting text
(thanks to former MDS student Ryan Homer for developing this extension!).
By default,
it creates shortcuts for inserting two of the most common R operators: `<-` and `%>%`.
Run the following from terminal to install the extension:

```
jupyter labextension install @techrah/text-shortcuts
jupyter lab build
```

To check that the extension is working,
open JupyterLab,
launch an R notebook,
and try inserting the operators by pressing `Alt` + `-` or `Shift` + `Command` + `m`, respectively.

## LaTeX

We will install the lightest possible version of LaTeX and it's necessary packages as possible so that we can render Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown documents to html and PDF. If you have previously installed LaTeX, please uninstall it before proceeding with these instructions.

First, open RStudio and run the following commands to install the `tinytex` package and setup `tinytex`:

```
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

> Note: You might be asked to enter your password during installation.
> If you see an error message towards the end of the installation
> telling you that `/usr/local/bin` is not writeable,
> you will need to open a terminal and run the following two commands before proceeding:
>
>```
> sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local/bin
> ~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr path add
>```

You can check that the installation is working by opening a terminal and asking for the version of latex:

```
latex --version
```

You should see something like this if you were successful:

```
pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020)
kpathsea version 6.3.2
Copyright 2020 Han The Thanh (pdfTeX) et al.
There is NO warranty.  Redistribution of this software is
covered by the terms of both the pdfTeX copyright and
the Lesser GNU General Public License.
For more information about these matters, see the file
named COPYING and the pdfTeX source.
Primary author of pdfTeX: Han The Thanh (pdfTeX) et al.
Compiled with libpng 1.6.37; using libpng 1.6.37
Compiled with zlib 1.2.11; using zlib 1.2.11
Compiled with xpdf version 4.02
```

The above is all we need to have LaTeX work with R Markdown documents, however for Jupyter we need to add several more packages. Do this by opening a terminal and copying the following there press enter:

```
tlmgr install eurosym \
  adjustbox \
  caption \
  collectbox \
  enumitem \
  environ \
  fp \
  jknapltx \
  ms \
  parskip \
  pgf \
  rsfs \
  tcolorbox \
  titling \
  trimspaces \
  ucs \
  ulem \
  upquote
```

To test that your latex installation is working with jupyter notebooks,
launch `jupyter lab` from a terminal and open either a new notebook
or the same one you used to test IRkernel above.
Go to `File -> Export notebook as... -> Export Notebook to PDF`.
If the PDF file is created,
your LaTeX environment is set up correctly.

## PostgreSQL

We will be using PostgreSQL as our database management system. You can [download PostgreSQL 12.4 from [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgresql) (do *not* select version 13). Follow the instructions for the installation. In the password page, type whatever password you want, but make sure you'll remember it later. For all the other options, use the default. You do not need to run "StackBuilder" at the end of the installation (if you accidentally launch the StackBuilder, click "cancel", you don't need to check any boxes).

To test if the installation was successful open the `SQL Shell` app from the LaunchPad or applications directory. You will be asked to setup your configuration, accept the default value (the one within square brackets) for the first four values by pressing enter four times, then type in your password and press enter one last time. It should look like this if it is working correctly:

<img src="../images/psql-mac.png" alt = ""/>

## Docker

You will use Docker to create reproducible, sharable and shippable computing environments for your analyses. For this you will need a Docker account. You can [sign up for a free one here](https://store.docker.com/signup?next=%2F%3Fref%3Dlogin).

After signing-up and signing into the Docker Store, go here: [https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) and click on the "Get Docker" button on the right hand side of the screen. Then follow the installation instructions on that screen to install the stable version.

To test if Docker is working, after installation open the Docker app by clicking on its icon (from Finder, Applications or Launchpad). Next open Terminal and type the following:
```
docker run hello-world
```
you should see something like this if you were successful:

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:451ce787d12369c5df2a32c85e5a03d52cbcef6eb3586dd03075f3034f10adcd
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

## Post-installation notes

You have completed the installation instructions, well done 🙌!
We have created a script to help you check that your installation was successful,
and to provide instructions for how you can troubleshoot any potential issues.
To run this script,
please execute the following command from your terminal.

```
bash <(curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/UBC-MDS.github.io/master/resources_pages/check-setup-mds.sh)
```

The output from running the script will look something like this:

````
# MDS setup check 0.1.0

If a program or package is marked as MISSING,
this means that you are missing the required version of that program or package.
Either it is not installed at all or the wrong version is installed.
The required version is indicated with a number and an asterisk (*),
e.g. 4.* means that all versions starting with 4 are accepted (4.0.1, 4.2.5, etc).

You can run the following commands to find out which version
of a program or package is installed (if any):
```
name_of_program --version  # For system programs
conda list  # For Python packages
R -q -e "installed.packages()[,c(Package, Version)]"  # For R packages
```

This output and additional configuration details
have been saved to the file check-setup-mds.log in this directory.
````

As you can see at the end of the output,
a log file is saved in your current directory.
We might ask you to upload this file
if we need to troubleshoot your installation,
so that we can help you more effectively.
If any of your packages are marked as "MISSING"
you will need to figure out what is wrong and possibly reinstall them.
Once all packages are marked as "OK"
we will ask you to submit this log file,
so that we can confirm that your installation was successful.
Details on where to submit will be provided later.

> Note that in general you should be careful running scripts unless they come from a trusted source as in this case (just like how you should be careful when downloading and installing programs on your computer). -->
