# Class 3 - Jupyter Lab, RStudio, Code Spaces, VS Code

We are going to spend a bit of time today working with the tools we have installed to get you familiarized with them, and get them "tuned" up.
This will mostly be demos and I hope it is very interactive and you ask lots of questions.

## Outline

1. Extending Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebooks (20 minutes)
    - Exporting and saving notebooks
    - Version Control of Notebooks: [the problem](https://nextjournal.com/schmudde/how-to-version-control-jupyter) and [the solution](https://towardsdatascience.com/version-control-with-jupyter-notebook-b9630bc5996e)
    - [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - [JupyText](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
    - [Support for Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support)
    - Code formatter in Jupyter Lab

2. RStudio (10 minutes)

3. Demo of Code Spaces (10 minutes)

4. VS Code extensions (20 minutes)
